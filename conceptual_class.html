        <h3> <u> LOONEY TUNES </u></h3>
        <p>
            Looney Tunes is an American animated franchise produced and distributed by Warner Bros. 
            It began as a series of short films that originally ran from 1930 to 1969,
             concurrently with its partner series Merrie Melodies, during the golden age of
              American animation.Following a revival in the late 1970s, 
              new shorts were released as recently as 2014. <br>
              The two series introduced a large cast of characters, 
              including Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and Porky Pig. 
              The term Looney Tunes has since been expanded to also refer to the characters themselves.
